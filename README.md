Title: GUI-Based Calculator with Exception Handling Mechanism
Introduction:
This project is a Java-based graphical user interface (GUI) calculator that includes an exception handling mechanism. The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, and square root calculations. It features a user-friendly interface created using Java Swing components. Exception handling ensures the application handles errors gracefully, providing a robust user experience by preventing crashes due to invalid inputs or operations like division by zero.


Limitation of the Application:
Limited Functionality: The calculator only supports basic arithmetic operations. More advanced functions (e.g., trigonometric functions, logarithms) are not implemented.
UI Scaling Issues: The current layout might not scale well on different screen sizes or resolutions, potentially affecting usability.
Single Operation at a Time: The calculator performs only one operation at a time. It does not support chaining multiple operations without intermediate results.
Error Handling: While basic exception handling is implemented, more complex error scenarios (e.g., input of multiple dots) are not covered.
No Memory Function: The calculator lacks memory functions (e.g., M+, M-, MR)
